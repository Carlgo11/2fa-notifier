Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is a fantastic way to 
make it harder for hackers to hijack your accounts, even 
if they somehow steal your password.

**But, it only works if you actually enable it!!**

2FA Notifier let's you know which sites you visit
support 2FA and specifically how to enable it.

Anytime you visit a site that supports 2FA, a notification 
will pop up in the top right of your computer. When you click 
on it, you will be brought directly to the site's documentation
explaining how to enable 2FA.

**The right information, right when you need it!**

Better protect your accounts from hackers by 
[installing 2FA Notifier][install]
and enabling 2FA everywhere you can!

## Open Source
The source code for the 2FA Notifier extension
is available in its [Github repo](https://github.com/conorgil/2fa-notifier).
