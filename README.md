# [2FA Notifier](https://2fanotifier.org/)

2FA Notifier is a web extension that notifies users
whether or not the sites they visit support 
two factor authentication (2FA).

It utilizes the data from the [twofactorauth.org](https://twofactorauth.org)
project to determine which sites do and do not support 2FA.
